# Final-Grade-Utility
This project asks you to write a utility program that is given input via the standard input describing the set of graded artifacts for a course, the students enrolled in the course, and their scores on the various artifacts. Additionally, it is given a sequence of cutpoint sets describing the cutpoints to achieve various grade levels. The program's output is twofold: the total score received by each student in the course and, for each cutpoint set, final course grades for each student.
